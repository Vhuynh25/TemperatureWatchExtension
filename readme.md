# Temperature Watch Extension

An extension that tells a user when the forecast for their geolocation exceeds thresholds set by the user in the options page.

I would have the extension alert the user automatically but unfortunately, various restrictions I discovered during the development process prevent me to doing so.

Important: Make sure to go to extension options after installing to setup thresholds
